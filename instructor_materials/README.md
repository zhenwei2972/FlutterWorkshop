## Instructor materials

This content will be run as a short [workshop](./workshop.md), where you will lead students in building a flutter app
It is OK to spend extra time on foundational material.
Trainers do not need to be expert on the subject matter, infact if you have just picked up the content, you may have the context that makes teaching it more easy.
